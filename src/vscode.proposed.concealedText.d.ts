		 * - `auto` (default): neither side. The stop is the end the caret was travelling towards;
		 *   a caret already at either end stays, and an arrival with no direction falls back to
		 *   the end. Everything typed there lands at the stop.
		 * - `before`: the text in front of the range, as a closing delimiter. The stop is the
		 *   range's start: typed characters land in front of the range, a line break or
		 *   whitespace behind it, so `**bold**` closes before the line breaks.
		 * - `after`: the text behind the range, as an opening delimiter. The stop is the range's
		 *   end: typed characters land behind the range, a line break or whitespace in front of
		 *   it.
		 * - `lineStart`: the line, from its first column. As `after`, but a line break typed at
		 *   the stop goes in front of the whole line, which moves down with the caret still at
		 *   the stop; the range keeps the first column of its text.
		 * - `lineEnd`: the line, to its last column. As `before`, but whitespace typed at the
		 *   stop stays in front of the range, so nothing follows it on its line.
		 *
		 * `auto`, `before` and `after` are read only when nothing is drawn in the range's place,
		 * since a replacement has a side per end; `lineStart` and `lineEnd` apply drawn or not.
		 * A paste at the stop is split the same way at its line breaks. A join of two lines does
		 * not move the range. `deletionPolicy: 'protect'` keeps the delete keys off it.
